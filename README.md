Scripts for running Qt 5.15 binaries on CentOS 7.0

Within this repostiory lies scripts that aid in running Linux binaries
built with The Qt Company built Qt libraries (from the Qt installer
you can get at https://account.qt.io/downloads) for Linux.

The Qt Company built libraries are built on RHEL 7.6, and so, to be
able to run these on CentOS 7.0, you need some CentOS 7.6 libraries.

The script get_qt-5.15.2-centos70-deplibs does this.

The other scripts are an evolution of what is contained in the above
mentioned script.

For more information, look at the scripts.
